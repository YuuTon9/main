== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `RecipeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `RecipeBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a recipe).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Recipe Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Recipe>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Recipe Book`, which `Recipe` can reference. This would allow `Recipe Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Recipe` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/recipe/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Recipe Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.recipe.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::basic[]
=== Basic commands

==== Help command


==== Switch command

image::SwitchActivityDiagram.png[]

==== List command


==== Find command


==== Add command


==== Edit command


==== Delete command


==== Favourite and Unfavourite commands


==== Undo and Redo commands
Description: TODO

===== Implementation
This section explains how the undo and redo commands are implemented.

1. TODO

The following sequence diagram shows what happens when the user calls an undo operation:

.Undo command sequence diagram
image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[]

Result: TODO

===== Design Considerations
====== Aspect: How undo and redo executes
Challenges faced: TODO

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire recipe book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May use up a lot of memory space within a single session 1) if there is a large volume of recipe book commits
and/or 2) if the magnitude of a single commit is large (ie. the database is huge, containing many recipes).

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory.
** Cons: Tedious to ensure the correctness of the implementation of each individual command.

==== Clear command


==== Exit command


// end::basic[]

// tag::recipecustomisation[]
=== Recipe customisation commands
==== Add ingredient command


==== Edit ingredient command


==== Delete ingredient command


==== Add step command


==== Edit step command


==== Delete step command

// end::recipecustomisation[]


// tag::advancedfilter[]
=== Filter command
The advanced filter feature uses the `filter` command to search for recipes according to the set of keywords provided
by the user. Think of it as a greatly enhanced and more robust version of the `find` command, which only allows the
user to find recipes by their name.

==== Implementation
This section explains how the filter command is implemented.

1. User specified keywords are directed to the `FilterCommandParser` where `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap`
are used to parse the user input. An error will be thrown if no keywords are specified at all.

2. The parsed user input is then fed into `RecipeMatchesKeywordPredicate` where a `Predicate`, p, is created. This
predicate will subsequently be used as the filter to get all recipes that meet the user specified criteria.

3. A new `FilterCommand` object will be created with the predicate and returned to the `LogicManager`.

4. The `FilterCommand#execute(model)` method is executed and `Model#updateFilteredRecipeList(p)` is called. This tests
every recipe in the database against the predicate, p, and updates the filtered recipe list with recipes that meet the
user specified criteria.

5. Once complete, this filtered recipe list is displayed to the user.

Here is a sample sequence diagram that shows what happens when the user inputs `filter favourites t/20 ig/Pasta`:

.Advanced filter sequence diagram
image::AdvancedFilterSequenceDiagram.png[]

This operation displays all recipes that 1) are marked as favourites, 2) take 20 minutes or less to prepare,
and 3) contains pasta as an ingredient.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Consistency of user input format
One concern we had while implementing this feature was the sheer number of commands and prefixes that our app had.
Eventually, the current implementation was chosen because we didn't want to define a new format for `filter`
keywords which might potentially confuse our users.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses the existing prefixes and format in the user input.
** Pros: The existing `ArgumentTokenizer` and `ArgumentMultimap` classes already have capabilities to parse user input
that is in a certain format. Thus, using the same format saves us time and effort in implementing our own parser. It
also spares the user from having to remember multiple formats / keywords.
** Cons: The user has to be familiar with the prefixes and other special keywords in order to use this feature to its
fullest potential.

* **Alternative 2:** Define new keywords that the user can use. These keywords could be "more english-like" as opposed
to using shortened tags as prefixes.
** Pros: Easy to remember these keywords since they are more english-like.
** Cons: We must implement our own parser which is tedious. The user will also have to remember a new set of keywords
on top of the existing prefixes. This is double work for the user.
// end::advancedfilter[]

// tag::planning[]
=== Planning feature
==== Proposed Implementation
The planning feature uses the `PlannedRecipeMap` to store a `Recipe` at a `Date`.

Given below is a sequence diagram on how a recipe can be scheduled on a date.

image::PlanningSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How recipes are scheduled

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Scheduled recipes are saved in a separate data structure.
** Pros: Scheduled recipes can be easily obtained and sorted.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage if a large number of recipes are scheduled.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the date that the scheduled recipe is scheduled on as another attribute to the Recipe class.
** Pros: Easy to implement, no additional data structure added.
** Cons: All scheduled recipes can not be easily seen and sorted.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the scheduled recipes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a tree map to store the scheduled recipes in a <Date, List<Recipe>> key-value pair.
** Pros: Allows us to easily and intuitively access the list of recipes scheduled on a certain day.
** Cons: Obtaining all the recipes scheduled across a period of time will not be very efficient.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a List sorted by increasing time.
** Pros: Easy to implement, uncomplicated data structure.
** Cons: Hard to obtain the scheduled recipes on a certain date, as we do not know which index
corresponds to the date we are interested in.
// end::planning[]

// tag::goals[]
=== Goals feature
==== Proposed Implementation

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How goals are being tagged

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** System generates tags for each recipe based on food algorithm.
** Pros: Higher accuracy and makes use of inputs of ingredients class.
** Cons: Would require several criteria checks that may not be intuitive and would require the use of artificial intelligence for the highest accuracy.

* **Alternative 2 :** User chooses from 4 given goals and user adds the tags to the recipes.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Is dependant on user's understanding and not universal understanding of what may be deemed healthy.

===== Aspect: How to determine the criteria for each goal

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Check by quantity
** Pros: More accurate and can be modelled against ideal ratio of a healthy meal.
** Cons: Harder to implement as we need to standardise the ingredient measurements, not as intuitive.

* **Alternative 2 :** Check by variety
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Not as accurate as one grain of rice would still be counted as variety.
// end::goals[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
