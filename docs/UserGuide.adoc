== Introduction

*HealthyBaby* (HYBB) is a desktop application that provides you with a database of quick, easy, and healthy recipes.
Whether you are a university student, a working adult, or even a retiree, as long as you want to plan and cook your
own meals, this app is just for you! We designed HYBB to alleviate the challenges faced while maintaining healthy
eating habits, easing the transition from eating out everyday to cooking healthy meals regularly.

*Value proposition*: Focuses on healthy, simple recipes with short cooking time with ingredients filter to
minimise food wastage.

HYBB is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Through our convenient filters, searching and planning for new healthy recipes will be a breeze.

Get motivated through our eye-catching goals and achievements.

== Overview
The main features of HYBB are as follows:

=== Filter
HYBB enables filtering by specific components in the recipes such as goals, favourites, and ingredients in order to
reduce the time needed to find recipes that suit your needs.

=== Planning
To allow students to plan their meals in advance while considering the available ingredients,
HYBB enables bulk planning of ingredients required for the following week.

=== Goal
To enable students to pick a goal to work towards and track their progress, HYBB provides 3 main types of goals that
can be tracked: “Wholesome Wholemeals”, “Bulk like a Hulk” and “Herbivore”.

=== Achievements
This feature aims to encourage students to continue their healthy eating by showing visual evidence of their progress
through streaks and images of healthy food that they uploaded.
